# LAUNCHPAD contracts

This repo contains some of the contracts I'm building for a new LaunchPad.

The folder here contains some:
--> Implementation tokens (e.g StandardERC20 & LiquidityGenerationToken (LP Tokens))
--> Contract factories which can make duplicates of the implementations for several clients.

It's been an interesting project so far.

NOTE: The contracts here are just samples. The main business logic is saved in a private repo.
